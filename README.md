# Jakob Nissen's Julia course, October 2021
This is a part of a larger introductory Julia course for biologists.
The part in this repository covers some important packages of the BioJulia ecosystem.

This repo contains slides in PDF formats, as well as exercises/solution pairs.
There is a complimentary `data` directory which is too big to be part of this repo - it will be distributed alongside with this repo.
Send me an email if you are from the future and need a link to the data directory.
For now, the data is stored at:

## Content:
    Day 1: Population genetics with popgen
    Day 2: Introduction to BioJulia and BioSequences
    Day 3: BioJulia parsers, FASTX and kmers
    Day 4: Sequence alignment with BioAlignments
    Day 5: High throughput alignment with XAM.jl

There is no introduction to Julia, the students are expected to already know the basics of the language.
The slides are superficial, providing only enough information to solve the exercises.
Hence, it is not an introduction to bioinformatics either.
